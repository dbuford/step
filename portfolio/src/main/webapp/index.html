          <h3> All About Me!</h3>
          <p> Hi, my name is Dominique Buford. I am from Dallas, Texas, I'm a sophomore at Duke University, and I plan
               to major in Computer Science. At Duke, I am a member of the Baldwin Scholars Program and the MireCourt Selective
               Living Group. I've grown up always watching sports with my dad, so, of course, my favorite part of Duke 
               is attending the Duke Men's and Women's Basketball games. <br><br>
            I am also very close with my family and I love spending time with them! My family includes my mom, my dad,
             my two sisters, Brianna and Cortney, and my two dogs, T.J. and Bella. Recently, we have enjoyed participating
             in "Quarantine Olympics", which consists of a series of At-Home Challenges.

            <h3> Why Computer Science? </h3>
          <p> Ever since I can remember, I have always been interested in learning how 
              things around us function. From my favorite Robot Puppy toy to more advanced items like the television,
              everything seemed to peak my interest and curiosity. As my involvement with technology increased, 
              I became even more interested on how it all worked. More importantly, I wanted to know how I, myself, 
              could create something of my own with technology. <br> <br>I believe that coding is a unique way to combine 
              technology and creativity to produce amazing and useful projects that can impact the world
              around us. Fortunately, since technology continues to rapidly evovle before our very eyes,
              there is always so many new things to learn. In order to continue to build upon my current coding 
              knowledge,this summer, I have the opportunity to be apart of Google's STEP, Student Training in 
              Engineering Program, internship.
